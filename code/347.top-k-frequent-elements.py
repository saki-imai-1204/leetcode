# Notes (6/5/2023)

# Potential solution: Use max heap
# For each element, count the number of occurrences and put them in a set
# We donâ€™t have to sort the whole hashmap because we only want the top k elements
# Heapify() can be done in linear time
# Each pop will be O(logn)
# So, the time complexity is O(k*logn)

# Solution in linear time:
# Use an array where the position represents a count and the value represent the number
# Notice that the size of the array is bounded to n where n is the number of elements in the input
# time complexity: O(n)
# space complexity: O(n)
#   - Array and hashmap to count the occurrences of each value
